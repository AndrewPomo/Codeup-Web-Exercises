 # Codeup Web Exercises

 Hi there! Welcome to my Codeup Web Exercises repository. My name is Andrew Powell-Morse, and I'm a marketer who is excited to learn how to supplement my career with the ability to code!
 
 In this repository, you'll find everything from the very first meaningful lines of code I ever wrote (yikes!), to my final Codeup Demo Day project. You're free to have a look at all of it and use it as you please. 

 Thanks for stopping by!
